All Code and Findings for My Data Science Capstone Project

My Capstone project was an attempt to accurately predict windspeed for my personal weather station based upon hitorical data obtained from other personal weather statiosn in my surrounding area. I compared and contrasted various permutations of ten different regression models resulting in twenty-two total trials.

All coding was performed in Google Colabratory notebooks. Modeling was primarily done using Scikit Learn with visualizations via Matplotlib.
